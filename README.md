PubMed Research Paper Fetcher
=============================

Overview
--------

The PubMed Research Paper Fetcher is a Python program that interacts with the PubMed API to retrieve and process research papers based on a given search query. The program is designed to filter papers authored by individuals affiliated with pharmaceutical or biotech companies and save the results in a CSV file for further analysis.

Key Features
------------

-   Fetch research papers from PubMed using a search query.
-   Identify non-academic authors based on their affiliations.
-   Save filtered results to a CSV file for easy analysis.
-   Modular design for flexibility and reusability.

How It Works
------------

### Core Components

#### 1\. **PubMedFetcher Class**

The `PubMedFetcher` class handles the main functionality of the program:

-   **`fetch_papers(query: str)`**: Fetches and processes papers matching the search query.
-   **`_search_papers(query: str)`**: Retrieves PubMed IDs for papers matching the query.
-   **`_fetch_details(ids: List[str])`**: Fetches detailed metadata for each paper using their PubMed IDs.
-   **`_filter_papers(papers: List[Dict])`**: Filters papers to identify authors affiliated with companies.
-   **`_is_academic_author(affiliation: str)`**: Determines if an author is academic based on keywords in their affiliation.

#### 2\. **CSV Export**

The program saves the filtered results to a CSV file, including fields like:

-   PubMed ID
-   Title
-   Publication Date
-   Non-academic Author(s)
-   Company Affiliation(s)

### Filtering Logic

The program identifies non-academic authors by checking affiliations for the absence of keywords like `"university"`, `"institute"`, `"college"`, `"school"`, `"lab"`, and `"hospital"`.

Installation
------------

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.7 or higher
-   `requests` library for making API calls

### Steps

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>

    ```

2.  Run the script:

    ```
    python pubmed_fetcher.py "<your-query>"

    ```

* * * * *

Usage
-----

### Example

1.  Run the program with a query, e.g., `"cancer treatment"`:

    ```
    python pubmed_fetcher.py "cancer treatment"

    ```

2.  The program fetches, filters, and saves the results to `output.csv`.
3.  Open the `output.csv` file to view the results.

### Command-Line Arguments

-   `query` (required): The search query for PubMed.
-   `--file` (optional): The filename to save the results. Default is `output.csv`.
-   `--debug` (optional): Enable debug mode for detailed logs.

Example:

```
python pubmed_fetcher.py "diabetes" --file diabetes_results.csv --debug

```

Code Structure

### Main Files

-   `pubmed_fetcher.py`: The main script containing the `PubMedFetcher` class and CLI implementation.
-   `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.

### Key Methods

-   `fetch_papers(query: str)`: Fetches and processes papers matching the query.
-   `_search_papers(query: str)`: Searches for PubMed IDs.
-   `_fetch_details(ids: List[str])`: Retrieves detailed metadata.
-   `_filter_papers(papers: List[Dict])`: Filters papers for non-academic authors.

* * * * *

Results
-------

The output is saved as a CSV file containing:

-   **PubMed ID**: Unique identifier for the paper.
-   **Title**: Title of the paper.
-   **Publication Date**: Date of publication.
-   **Non-academic Author(s)**: Names of non-academic authors.
-   **Company Affiliation(s)**: Affiliations of non-academic authors.

* * * * *

Limitations
-----------

-   API rate limits: Ensure compliance with PubMed's API usage policies.
-   Filtering accuracy: Some affiliations may be incorrectly categorized due to ambiguous keywords.
-   Limited to metadata: The program does not fetch full-text articles.

* * * * *

Future Enhancements
-------------------

-   Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier usage.
-   Add support for additional output formats (e.g., JSON, Excel).
-   Include advanced filtering options for affiliations.
